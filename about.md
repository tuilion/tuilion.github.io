I'm not here to sell you a dream.  
I'm here to **build things**. Quietly. Consistently. Publicly.

I've spent years in academia, teaching, publishing, and helping others get better at thinking.  
Now I'm using that same clarity, discipline, and obsession with logic to learn and build in the open.

This blog documents my transition from academic life to building tools, learning security, and working with code.  
It's not about grand visions or quick wins.  
It's about **building a life that fits me better**.

I believe in strong fundamentals, curiosity-driven work, and getting my hands dirty.  
If that resonates, you're welcome to follow along.
