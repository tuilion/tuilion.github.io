The other day I was reading about _piping_ on Unix with `|`, and while creating a new `.md` file for this blog post, I used `cp 2025-07-13-academia-goodbye.md 2025-07-14-network-games.md | subl 2025-07-14-network-games.md` in my Mac terminal. Anyway, I was feeling pretty smart - until ChatGPT pointed out that this was not necessary because "`cp` carries nothing". Basically, in this situation `|` does nothing, except enabling me to write the command in one line. Well... you learn...

### Network curiosities
While learning networking on TryHackMe a few days ago, I learned about ARP packets and network scanning, MAC addresses, and of course I was curious to see what devices are currently attached to my home network, so I did a quick `sudo arp-scan`. What I found was suprisingly interesting. First of all, I had several `unknown` devices on my network, and secondly, some devices appeared and disappeared between scans. Below is the image which illustrates this behaviour.

</p>

We can see that there are multiple unknown devices on my network. So... what? ðŸ˜„ Next, I used `nslookup` to actually find the names of the devices, and _voilÃ _  - all those locally administered "unknowns" turned out to be Android phones!

</p>

### Lessons learned

1. Android phones show up as `unknown` when using `arp-scan`.
2. Android phones connect and disconnect from the network - probably to conserve battery power.
3. Piping with `|` is sometimes redundant. ðŸ˜‚

### Next steps
I will continue learning about networks. I want to deepen my knowledge to be able to use it in real-life, especially at home. Also, I plan to build a Python-based network scanner that will be able to:
1. Scan my network every 30 seconds.
2. Log the scans into a .txt file.
3. Alert me if unknown devices appear on the network.

This will be an exercise in Python, in networking, and in cybersecurity.

_Post-scriptum:_ This was a quick exercise, I am aware there are also other devices on my network that could be looked up and discovered. That's for next time.

_Until next time, happy network scanning._
