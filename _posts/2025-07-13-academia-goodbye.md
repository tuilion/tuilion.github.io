_A personal transition from academic life to something more free, more real._

#### The Realisation

I was at a party - coincidentally, my birthday party. For over a year, I had been thinking things over. I was going back and forth in my head, feeling stuck in the same surroundings, often unmotivated and frustrated. But quitting? That never seemed like a real option. Until that one moment when a single, quiet thought hit me:

**‚ÄúI can quit my job.‚Äù**

It wasn‚Äôt emotional or dramatic - it was calm, obvious, and sharp. From that moment, something shifted. My mind woke up and began spinning with new possibilities. The next day, the next week, the next month - everything felt different. I started actively exploring what I wanted from life, what I enjoyed doing, and where I could go next.

#### A Decade in Academia

I spent ten years in science. I completed a PhD - which took nearly a year to write - and invested many more years in research, writing, collaboration, and teaching. I didn‚Äôt do it for the money. I did it because I wanted a meaningful career, something that challenged and fulfilled me. And for a long time, I believed in it. But over time, that belief began to fade. I found myself questioning the structure, the system, and whether any of it was still aligned with the person I had become.

#### üí° Why I Decided to Leave

There wasn‚Äôt just one reason. It was a combination of things that added up over time. But here are the ones that mattered most:

- **Low salary**  
  I never expected to get rich in science. But after ten years, a PhD, and a solid record of projects and collaborations, I was still earning what many people make in completely unrelated roles. At some point, it stopped making sense. I felt like I was treating my job as a serious calling, but the system treated it like a hobby.

- **Micromanagement**  
  I‚Äôm someone who needs freedom and responsibility to thrive. My boss wasn‚Äôt a bad person - he cared about people, understood family life, built projects. But he was involved in everything. Even when others had ideas, they were often reframed and folded into his plans. Once, on a business trip, he signed me up for activities without asking. I know he meant well. But for me, it became a symbol of something deeper - a lack of space to grow, to fail, or to own anything fully.

- **Slow advancement**  
  The academic system runs on patience and obedience. You wait. You follow the path. You stay ‚Äúin the system.‚Äù But I‚Äôve never believed in waiting for permission to grow. I believe in doing the work and showing what I can do. And when that drive hits a wall of slow promotions and vague timelines, frustration builds.

- **The system itself**  
  My job became 80 percent administration. Project reports, grant documents, endless forms. I understand the constraints of funding and accountability. But if I wanted to manage forms and workflows full-time, I would‚Äôve gone into project management. And the publication culture didn‚Äôt help - perfect formatting, publishing behind paywalls, chasing points instead of insight. At some point, I realised: this isn‚Äôt the science I believe in.

#### What I‚Äôm Building Instead

That night, I made two clear decisions:

1. I want to work remotely.  
2. I want to work for a company - probably outside my country - that pays fairly and values initiative.

That‚Äôs the new foundation I‚Äôm building. In the short term, I‚Äôm planning to start freelancing - creating Python programs, offering consultative help, solving real problems. Long term, I want to work in IT, ideally cybersecurity - something real, challenging, and rewarding. Money will give my family more freedom. Remote work will give me control over how and where I live. A week by the sea? A month in Spain? Why not. I‚Äôll bring my work with me.

And most importantly ‚Äî I don‚Äôt need someone managing me to stay responsible. I‚Äôve always been that way. I just want to do the work on my terms. I‚Äôve earned that.

#### Five Years from Now

If I had stayed, I know where I‚Äôd be in five years - same role, same salary, same ceiling. That‚Äôs not the future I want.

Instead, I hope I‚Äôll look back at this moment and smile. I hope I‚Äôll be grateful that I jumped, even when it was uncertain. That I stopped waiting for permission, and finally claimed my seat at the table.

**Until next time, embrace the realisation.**
