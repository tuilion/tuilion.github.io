A running list of the tools, gear, workflows, and mental states I rely on daily — updated regularly as my life evolves.


#### 💻 Hardware
- **MacBook Air 15 M4** – used for study, quiet coding with Python, and light automation
- **Desktop PC** – Windows 11, 1440p monitor (160Hz), RTX 3060 Ti – used for heavy-lifting VMs and home office
- **Samsung Galaxy S23+** – ChatGPT conversations and social media
- **Walking pad** – for staying active during podcasts, learning, and some coding sessions
- **Headphones** – _brand and model coming soon_


#### 🧰 Software & Tools
- **Terminal** – `zsh`
- **Git & GitHub** – for code, blog repo, and project logs
- **ChatGPT** – daily assistant, project feedback, Python help
- **Tunnelblick** – VPN client for connecting to TryHackMe labs
- **Remote Desktop (Windows App)** – for RDP access to TryHackMe machines or my desktop PC


#### 🧠 Workflows & Systems
- **Daily structure**:
  - 3 days/week Python (5–6h/day), 3 days/week cybersecurity (TryHackMe + books)
  - Nightly blog writing (aim: publish each Sunday)
- **Progress tracking** – simple notes + self-feedback
- **Frequent setup changes** – rotate workspaces (desk, floor, farmhouse, park) to reduce pain
- **Smoke-free since summer 2025** – tracking nicotine pouches and health changes


#### 🔐 Cybersecurity Stack (Learning)
- **TryHackMe** – Cyber Security 101 path
- **The Web Application Hacker’s Handbook** – theory + lab work
- **ungoogled Chromium** – privacy-focused browser setup
- *Next phase:* build mini red-team simulations and automate scans with Python


#### 🧠 Mental Systems
- **Builder-first** mindset — not into PR or social media
- Thrive on **structure**; avoid small goals unless part of a bigger mission
- Identity reset post-PhD 🤓 – shifting from academic to practical, creative, and independent
- **Blogging** as grounding ritual – 15–30 mins/night
- *Short-term plan*: freelance + projects; long-term: remote cybersecurity role + freedom
